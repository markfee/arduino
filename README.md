# arduino

This is repo has all of my arduino sketches
They are mostly just playing around and trying stuff out but feel free to download and use
anything that is of interest

Please note that I have pulled many of the initial sketches from elsewhere and then hacked away. As I started to 
get somewhere I thought about creating a repo. Many are the examples in the initial commit were shipped with the arduino IDE.
I have left any copyright notices inplace where applicable. Please get in touch if I have included your code in a way that you object to and I'll endevour to put things straight.
